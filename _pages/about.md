I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [Center for Data Science, New York University](https://cds.nyu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Shuyang Ling](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sling/index.html). Before joining Center for Data Science, I received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) with the senior thesis on community detection in directed graphs ([Exact recovery in stochastic coblock models](https://samzhong0702.github.io/files/Thesis.pdf) ) advised by  [Prof. Shuyang Ling](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sling/index.html).



My **research interest** generally lies in 

- Mathematics of Data Science: Optimization, Statistics, Inverse Problems, Spectral methods
- Machine Learning: Representation Learning, Clustering, Data Visualization
- Graphs and Networks: Community Detection, Graph Matching, Procrustes Matching
- Deep Learning: Theory, Application in Computer Vision



This is my [CV](https://samzhong0702.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
