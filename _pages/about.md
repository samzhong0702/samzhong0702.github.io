I'm currently a [Shanghai-track](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/data-science-phd-program) PhD student at [Center for Data Science, New York University](https://cds.nyu.edu/) supervised by [Prof. Shuyang Ling](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sling/index.html). I'm intersted in mathematical prospective of machine learning and optimization. Currently, I'm working on Procrustes Matching and Graph Mathching (also known as Quadratic Assignment), trying to find the information theoretical limits of these problems under different statistical settings and efficient algorithms to solve these NP-hard problems.

Before joining Center for Data Science, I did my undergraduate study at [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). Supervised by [Prof. Shuyang Ling](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sling/index.html), we partially solved [Exact recovery in stochastic coblock models](https://samzhong0702.github.io/files/Thesis.pdf), where we proved the information theoretical bound and proposed two algorithms that can acheive this bound.

This is my [CV](https://samzhong0702.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
